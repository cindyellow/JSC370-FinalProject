# Restaurants Performance During COVID-19: A Yelp Analysis

## About the Project

This was completed as a final project for the course "JSC370: Data Science II" at the University of Toronto. 

## Project Motivation & Description 

After the emergence of COVID-19 in early 2020, undoubtedly many businesses were forced to close temporarily or permanently. Throughout this time, restaurants in particular have undergone various modifications, such as disabling dine-in, starting takeout, etc. As a result, the food quality, service quality, and overall dining experience might have changed - whether in a positive or negative way.

For this study, I utilized data from Yelp, one of the biggest platforms that displays information of businesses and enable users to search for, react to, and/or share their opinions of such businesses. Their data come from a total of 6,990,280 reviews and 150,346 businesses from 11 metropolitan areas - Montreal, Calgary, Toronto, Pittsburgh, Charlotte, Urbana-Champaign, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Madison, and Cleveland. Only reviews that are [recommended](https://www.yelp-support.com/Recommended_Reviews) by Yelp are included. For privacy reasons, content of the datasets will not be disclosed.
